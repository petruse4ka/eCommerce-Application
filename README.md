# üõçÔ∏è eCommerce Application

This is the final team project for the **JavaScript/Front-end 2024Q4** course at **Rolling Scopes School**, developed by [**Konstantin Petrov**](https://github.com/petruse4ka), [**Daniil Biver**](https://github.com/tearzday) and [**Olga Paklonskaya**](https://github.com/pokolga) under the mentorship of [**Marharyta Malets**](https://github.com/margaryta-maletz).

Our team develops a responsive and fully functional üõçÔ∏è **eCommerce web application** that simulates real-world online shop. The platform allows users to get a full-scale online shopping experience from registration to checkout, offering an intuitive and engaging journey available on all devices üíªüì± with screen sizes as little as **390px**.

The main features of the application include:

- üîê **User Authorization** via a dedicated login form
- üõçÔ∏è **Browsing** a wide range of products
- üîé **Viewing** detailed product information
- üõí **Adding** products to a shopping basket
- üîç **Searching, sorting, and filtering** products
- üí≥ **Completing purchases** via a checkout page
- üåê **Integration with [CommerceTools](https://commercetools.com/)** for product management

## üöÄ Project setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Basic requirements

Make sure to have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version: **23.x** or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Verify installation by running in the console:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Setup Instructions

1. **Open the console and clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/petruse4ka/eCommerce-Application.git
```

This will create the new folder with all the files from the repository.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

```bash
cd ecommerce-application
```

3. **Install project dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all packages listed in `package.json`.

4. **Initialize Husky for Git hooks**

```bash
npm run prepare
```

This will set up Husky to run the Git hooks for pre-commit and other automation.

5. **Add environment configuration files**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following CommerceTools API variables:
```
VITE_CTP_PROJECT_KEY=your_project_key
VITE_CTP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
VITE_CTP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
VITE_CTP_AUTH_URL=your_auth_url
VITE_CTP_API_URL=your_api_url
VITE_CTP_SCOPES=your_api_scopes
```

Also create environment-specific files:
- `.env.development` - Used when running `npm run dev`
- `.env.production` - Used when running `npm run build`

These files should contain environment-specific configurations, including, but not limited to:
```
# .env.development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_DEBUG=true 

# .env.production
VITE_DEBUG=false
```

For local development, you can create a `.env.local` file which will override the values in `.env`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** 
> - Make sure that all the `.env` files are placed in `.gitignore` and are not committed to version control. 
> - All environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.
> - The loading order is: `.env` ‚Üí `.env.[mode]` ‚Üí `.env.local` ‚Üí `.env.[mode].local`
> - Later files override earlier ones.

6. **Start the development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Vite development server to test that the project has been setup correctly.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If your IDE shows TypeScript-related errors, make sure to check not only the installed TypeScript version but also the TypeScript configuration in your IDE. For **Visual Studio Code** select the TypeScript version by either:
>
> - Clicking the TypeScript version number in the bottom right corner and choosing "Use Workspace Version"
> - Or using the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and selecting "TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version" ‚Üí "Use Workspace Version"

## üé® Tailwind CSS Development Setup

### VS Code Extensions

To enhance your development experience with Tailwind CSS, install the following extension:

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense"
4. Click Install

This extension provides:

- Autocomplete suggestions
- Linting
- Hover previews

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure to open the project as a separate workspace in VS Code (File ‚Üí Open Folder ‚Üí select project folder) to ensure that the workspace-specific Tailwind CSS settings are properly applied. Opening the project as a subfolder of another workspace will not apply the correct settings.

### Font Configuration

To add new fonts to the project:

1. Add the font import URL in `src/styles/main.css`:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Your+Font&display=swap');
```

2. Configure the font in Tailwind theme in `src/styles/main.css`:

```css
@theme {
  --custom-font: 'Custom Font', sans-serif;
}
```

3. Use the font in the components:

```typescript
const font = ['custom-font'];
```

### Color Configuration

To add custom colors to the project:

1. Configure the colors in Tailwind theme in `src/styles/main.css`:

```css
@theme {
  --color-accent: #e7426a;
  --color-primary: #f7ebe5;
  --color-secondary: #4e9dd3;
}
```

2. Use the colors in the components:

```typescript
const styles = ['bg-color-accent', 'border-color-secondary', 'hover:bg-color-primary'];
```

## üìù Commit Naming Rules

Please use **clear, structured commit messages** following these prefixes:

- **`feat:`** ‚Äì for implementing a new feature  
  _Example:_ `feat: add paginator to cards list`

- **`fix:`** ‚Äì for fixing a bug in existing functionality

Ensure all commit messages follow this format to maintain consistency throughout the project. For other prefixes, check the **[convention documentation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** to ensure proper usage.

---

## üî† Enums/Constants Naming Rules

### General Guidelines

- Use **PascalCase** for enum names.
- Use **UPPER_CASE** for enum members and constants.
- Keep names **meaningful and clear**.
- **Avoid abbreviations** unless widely recognized.
- **Separate words with underscores** when necessary.

### Example Enums

```typescript
enum CardinalDirections {
  NORTH = 'North',
  EAST = 'East',
  SOUTH = 'South',
  WEST = 'West',
  SOUTH_WEST = 'South West',
}

enum UserRoles {
  ADMIN = 'Administrator',
  EDITOR = 'Editor',
  VIEWER = 'Viewer',
}
```

### Example Constants

```typescript
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.example.com';
const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  NETWORK_ERROR: 'Network connection lost',
  PERMISSION_DENIED: 'You do not have permission to perform this action',
  INVALID_PASSWORD: 'The provided credentials are incorrect',
};
```

---

### üß™ Testing Rules

Follow these guidelines for writing tests:

- Use **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)** style with `describe` and `test`
- Group related tests under `describe` blocks
- Write test descriptions that read like technical specifications:
  ```typescript
  describe('User Authentication', () => {
    test('should accept valid credentials', () => {
      // test code
    });
    test('should reject invalid password', () => {
      // test code
    });
  });
  ```
